# Background
China has thousands of miles of lakes and rivers, but it is still a country that is extremely short of
water. More than 400 of 600 cities in China are short of water, and two-third of cities have inadequate
water supplies. Such a lack of water, the reason, water pollution is the chief culprit. Facing with such
a severe water pollution, we came up with an economical solution to deal with that -- the surface cleaner
, which is called **Xcavenger**.
